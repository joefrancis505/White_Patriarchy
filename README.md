These are replication files for “Autumn of the White Patriarchy: Identity and Inequality in American Capitalism” by Joseph Francis.

In R script Inequality_v4.R provides the base analysis of the IPUMS data, which you will need to download separately. The various text files beginning “inequality” are the output.

The ods files “inequality.ods” and “voting.ods” contain the data used in the figures.

Comments for this repository are turned on, and I welcome all feedback.
